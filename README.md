# ðŸ“Š A Humanâ€“AI Collaborative Framework for Open Coding in Thematic Analysis

## Project Description

> The objective is to create an `Augmented AI Tool` for people who is in charge of data driven desitions, this way instead of reading all of the transcripts in an interview, or all of the comments down the business page in google maps he uses this tool and see the bad and the good 

>We aim to use AI to augment the human capacity in the decision making progress not to replace it.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- - `Optuna Logs.txt`: Here we keep the logs of about 30 runs on optuna we did to see what are the best Hyperparameters on the models
- - `palabras_50_sin_acentos.csv`: This is our dataset we use for the Dendogram-notebook
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data validation and analysis
- - `Dendogram-notebook.ipynb`: This is the initial notebook, in here we use **Sentence-Transformers** to vectorize words, than we use **UMAP** to pass them into a 2D space, then we apply **Agglomerative Clustering**, we use **Optuna** to optimize hyperparameters, we then make the dendogram and we use an local LLM in **Ollama** to ask for the labels in the intersections. 
- `Containerfile`: This is a containerfile for python and libraries.
- `Modelfile`: This is a file that stores the LLM we created **cal-state_words** (only answers with 1 word to any prompt).
- `Ollama.Dockerfile`: This is another containerfile for ollama and creating the cal-state_words LLM using the Modelfile
- `docker-compose.yml`: Template to compose both containerfiles
- `requirements.txt`: File with all the python libraries needed
- `README.md`: This file
